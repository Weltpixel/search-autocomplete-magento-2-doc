    <h2>ABOUT MAGENTO 2 AJAX AUTOCOMPLETE SEARCH EXTENSION.</h2>
    <h3>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? HOW DOES IT HELP?</h3>
<ul>
                        This Magento 2 search autocomplete extension helps customers find the right products so you can reduce friction and increase conversion!

The search bar is the starting point. Put yourself in the customer’s shoes and think about how you browse the internet. Whether it’s Google or an eCommerce website, the search functionality is crucial. Ask yourself, “How many times have I browsed Amazon or eBay to find a product I needed?” And, “How many times have I used the search bar to find exactly what I need?”

Customers can only purchase the products they need and want if they can find them! If your customers can’t quickly find the right products they are likely to leave and shop somewhere else. Don’t let bad store search ruin the user experience.

Did you know that search can reach a usage rate of more than 60%? Also, those same customers using search have a 2x to 3x higher conversion rate. If you’d like to test your own stats, look no further than your Google Analytics account. Behavior > Site Search > Search Terms. We think you’ll agree that your Magento store needs a great extension.

The site search process is an important feature to evaluate and improve! Effective sites guide customers as they are typing and re-formulating their search queries. These as-you-type search suggestions are here to help users save time by finding and correcting misspells.

The Ajax Search Autocomplete Magento Extension uses autosuggestion to help guide customers into recalling certain names and popular terms. By suggesting these search ideas you are giving ideas to help them construct more useful queries. This advanced search also allows quick access to the product suggested.

Autocomplete takes the autosuggest feature even further - enhancing the experience by visually displaying the most relevant products and pages. This reduces friction and takes the customer directly to the page they are looking for.
